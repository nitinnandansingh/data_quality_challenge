# Data Quality Challenge

This repository is meant for showcasing data analysis skills and involves exploration of a database with multiple tables. It contains a `notebooks` folder with 2 notebooks.
* [exploration](notebooks/01_explore_data.ipynb)
* [solution](notebooks/02_solutions.ipynb)

It also has a [report](https://github.com/nitinnandansingh/data_quality_challenge/blob/main/DQC_Report.docx) which answers the questions given below:
* Are the costs in the 'api_adwords_costs' table fully covered in the 'session_sources' table? Any campaigns where you see issues?
* Are the conversions in the 'conversions' table stable over time? Any pattern?
* Double check conversions ('conversions' table) with backend ('conversions_backend' table), any issues?
* Are attribution results consistent? Do you find any conversions where the 'ihc' values don't make sense?
* (Bonus) Do we have an issue with channeling? Are the number of sessions per channel stable over time?
* (Bonus) Any other issues?
